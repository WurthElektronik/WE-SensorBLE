# WE-SensorBLE

This Project contains the cross plattform project for the WE-SensorBLE Application using the Capacitor Framework.
Before using all requirements and dependencies must be resolved using the corresponding instructions below.

Please note: iOS development requires XCode which is restricted by Apple to be used on compatible Soft- and Hardware only!

Corresponding Feather M0 firmware can be found in the Sensor2BLE project inside the https://github.com/WurthElektronik/FeatherWings repository.

The released "WE-SensorBLE" Apps can be downloaded from the App stores of Apple and Google.

The Web App is available here : https://wurthelektronik.github.io/WE-SensorBLE/

## Requirements

Before starting or using the Project make sure all requirements and dependencies are resolved.
We recommend using Visual Studio Code as IDE/Editor for the Capacitor Project.

- Visual Studio Code 	refer to https://code.visualstudio.com/
- Android 			requires Android Studio & Android SDK, refer to https://developer.android.com/studio
- iOS 				requires XCode, refer to https://developer.apple.com/xcode/
- Node.JS 			refer to https://nodejs.org/en/ for download and install instructions including dependencies
- NPM 				refer to https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm for download and install instructions including dependencies



In order to install the required packages/dependencies for the project itself go to the root diretory of the project and run

```
npm install
npm install -g @ionic/cli
```
which will install all dependencies listed in package.json and also install the ionic cli

For other ways to install Capacitor Framework by Ionic, refer to https://capacitorjs.com/. Please note that following alternative instructions may not install required dependencies.

### Generating Progressive Web App

Run the following
```
ionic build
```
The built Web App is in /www

### Generating native Projects

After that run the following for iOS / XCode project generation
```
ionic cap build ios
```

Or the following for Android Studio project generation
```
ionic cap build android
```

This will build the project for the specified platform and open the native IDE (Android Studio or XCode).


### Known issues
- iOS: 
As Apple changes their connection timing from time to time and possibly with each OS revision we cannot ensure a proper latency vs. stability setting for all iOS devices and all iOS versions in the future.
